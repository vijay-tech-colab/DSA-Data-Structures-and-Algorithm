# DSA with JavaScript

Welcome to **DSA with JavaScript**! ðŸš€  
This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using JavaScript. The goal is to build a strong foundation in DSA, improve problem-solving skills, and document the learning journey.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

- **Learn DSA**: Understand core data structures and algorithms.
- **Practice**: Solve coding problems and gain confidence in DSA.
- **Share Knowledge**: Make learning resources accessible to others.

## ðŸš€ Learning Roadmap

### 1. **Basic JavaScript Concepts**
Before diving into DSA, make sure youâ€™re comfortable with JavaScript basics:
- Variables, Constants, Data Types
- Functions, Control Flow (if-else, loops)
- Array Methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, map, filter)
- Objects and Arrays
- ES6+ Features (let/const, arrow functions, destructuring)

### 2. **Introduction to Algorithms**
- Time and Space Complexity (Big O notation)
- Brute Force, Greedy, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking

### 3. **Arrays**
- Basic Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Searching
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary Search)
- Advanced Concepts: Multi-dimensional arrays

### 4. **Strings**
- Basic String Manipulations (length, substring, indexOf)
- Anagram Checking, Palindrome Checking
- Substring Search Algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp)

### 5. **Linked Lists**
- Singly, Doubly, Circular Linked Lists
- Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching
- Reversing a Linked List
- Detecting Cycles in a Linked List (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection)

### 6. **Stacks & Queues**
- Stack Operations (Push, Pop, Peek)
- Queue Operations (Enqueue, Dequeue)
- Applications: Expression Evaluation, BFS Traversal

### 7. **Trees**
- Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST)
- AVL Trees, Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Tree Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order)
- Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Searching
- Tree Balancing (AVL, Red-Black Trees)

### 8. **Graphs**
- Types of Graphs: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted
- Graph Traversal: DFS, BFS
- Algorithms: Dijkstraâ€™s (Shortest Path), Primâ€™s and Kruskalâ€™s (MST), Topological Sorting

### 9. **Hashing**
